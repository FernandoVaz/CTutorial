In this lesson, we will dive a little bit deep on assembly language, basically rewriting the hello world application in a more rustic language.

Note that we will be using assembly x86

Lets begin.

This is not intended to teach assembly, so i will resume just the basics in order to the files here be understandable

In assembly, comments are defined by ;

The data section is used to declare and initialize data or constants - You can declare various file names, buffer sizes in this sections. Note: Constants does not get modified when your program is running, means it does not modify at runtime;

the BSS sections we will not need, but it is used to declare variables

The text section is where the code will be written
generally, it starts with global _start, which tells the kernel (OS big brains, basically), where the program will start.

The syntax follows something like this:
[label] mnemonic [operands] [;comment]

simple, right?

With this knowledge, try to understand the hello_world.asm contained in this section

------------ wont go into details below this line, used for reference and self study -----------
