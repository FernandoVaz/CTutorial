Hello there.

This is a git commit course of the language C, its purpose is to help you navigate throught the course learning both git and C language without any audio-visual representation, so you could listen to some music at your leasure ;)

Iam using ubuntu to write this up. With sublime text as an editor and sometimes switching to neoVim.

This is a personal project so i dont really care what the results are going to be.


Well, lets get going.

First, we need to make sure we have compilers installed on our OS (which stands for operational system, btw). There are a lot of compilers nowadays for the language C, so your first task is to figure this out. 

Tip: Try typing gcc on your terminal to see if there is an interesting output
